# Nutrition Label

Welcome to my Nutrition Label project! This project is part of the Responsive Web Design curriculum offered by freeCodeCamp. It focuses on creating a responsive web page that displays a nutrition label for a food product.

## Project Overview

The Nutrition Label project aims to demonstrate my skills in building a responsive web page that effectively presents nutritional information for a food product. By completing this project, I will have the opportunity to apply my knowledge of HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing and informative nutrition label that adheres to standard labeling guidelines.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Nutrition Label project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to view the nutrition label web page.
3. Customize and modify the HTML and CSS files according to your preferences and requirements.
4. Update the nutritional information, ingredient list, and any other relevant details to reflect the specific food product you are creating the label for.
5. Test the responsiveness of the page across different devices and screen sizes to ensure it adapts seamlessly.

## Project Structure

The project directory is structured as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure and content of the nutrition label web page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that provides styles and layout for the HTML elements.

Feel free to explore and modify the project files to suit your specific needs and enhance the design and functionality of the nutrition label web page.
