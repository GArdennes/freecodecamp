# Product Landing Page

Welcome to my Product Landing Page project! This project is part of the Responsive Web Design curriculum offered by freeCodeCamp. It focuses on creating a responsive web page for showcasing a product and its features.

## Project Overview

The Product Landing Page project aims to demonstrate my skills in building a responsive web page that effectively promotes and presents a product to potential customers. By completing this project, I will have the opportunity to apply my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and responsive design to create an engaging landing page that highlights the product's key features and benefits.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Product Landing Page project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to view the landing page.
3. Customize and modify the HTML and CSS files according to your preferences and requirements.
4. Update the product details, features, pricing, and any other relevant information to reflect the specific product you are showcasing.
5. Test the responsiveness of the page across different devices and screen sizes to ensure it adapts seamlessly.

## Project Structure

The project directory is structured as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure and content of the landing page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that provides styles and layout for the HTML elements.

Feel free to explore and modify the project files to suit your specific needs and enhance the design and functionality of the landing page.
