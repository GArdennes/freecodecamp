# Ghanaian Proverbs Documentation

Welcome to my Ghanaian Proverbs Documentation project! This project is part of the Responsive Web Design curriculum offered by freeCodeCamp. It focuses on creating a responsive web page that showcases a collection of Ghanaian proverbs along with their meanings.

## Project Overview

The Ghanaian Proverbs Documentation project aims to demonstrate my skills in building a responsive web page that presents Ghanaian proverbs in an informative and visually appealing manner. By completing this project, I will have the opportunity to apply my knowledge of HTML and CSS to create a well-organized layout, style the proverb entries, and provide valuable insights into the wisdom and culture of Ghanaian proverbs.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Ghanaian Proverbs Documentation project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to view the documentation web page.
3. Customize and modify the HTML and CSS files according to your preferences and requirements.
4. Update the proverb entries, meanings, and any other relevant information to reflect your own collection of Ghanaian proverbs.
5. Test the responsiveness of the page across different devices and screen sizes to ensure it adapts seamlessly.

## Project Structure

The project directory is structured as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure and content of the documentation web page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that provides styles and layout for the HTML elements.

Feel free to explore and modify the project files to suit your specific needs and enhance the design and functionality of the documentation web page.
