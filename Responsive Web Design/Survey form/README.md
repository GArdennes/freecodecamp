# Survey Form

Welcome to my Survey Form project! This project is part of the Responsive Web Design curriculum offered by freeCodeCamp. It focuses on creating a responsive web page that allows users to participate in a survey by filling out a form.

## Project Overview

The Survey Form project aims to demonstrate my skills in building a responsive web page that collects user feedback through a survey form. By completing this project, I will have the opportunity to apply my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and form validation to create an intuitive and engaging survey experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Survey Form project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to view the survey form.
3. Customize and modify the HTML and CSS files according to your preferences and requirements.
4. Design the survey form by adding appropriate input fields, labels, and options to collect the necessary information from users.
5. Implement form validation and ensure that user inputs are validated correctly before submitting the form.

## Project Structure

The project directory is structured as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure and content of the survey form page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that provides styles and layout for the HTML elements.

Feel free to explore and modify the project files to suit your specific needs and enhance the design and functionality of the survey form page.
