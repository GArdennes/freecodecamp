# Cafe Menu

Welcome to my Cafe Menu project! This project is part of the Responsive Web Design curriculum offered by freeCodeCamp. It focuses on creating a responsive web page for showcasing a cafe menu.

## Project Overview

The Cafe Menu project aims to demonstrate my skills in building a responsive web page that presents a cafe menu in an attractive and user-friendly manner. By completing this project, I will have the opportunity to apply my knowledge of HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing layout, style menu items, and provide a delightful browsing experience for customers.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Cafe Menu project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to view the cafe menu web page.
3. Customize and modify the HTML and CSS files according to your preferences and requirements.
4. Update the menu items, descriptions, prices, and any other relevant information to reflect your own cafe menu.
5. Test the responsiveness of the page across different devices and screen sizes to ensure it adapts seamlessly.

## Project Structure

The project directory is structured as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure and content of the cafe menu web page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that provides styles and layout for the HTML elements.

Feel free to explore and modify the project files to suit your specific needs and enhance the design and functionality of the cafe menu web page.
