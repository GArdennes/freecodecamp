# Balance Sheet

Welcome to my Balance Sheet project! This project is part of the Responsive Web Design curriculum offered by freeCodeCamp. It focuses on creating a responsive web page for displaying a balance sheet.

## Project Overview

The Balance Sheet project aims to demonstrate my skills in building a responsive web page that showcases financial data in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner. By completing this project, I will have the opportunity to apply my knowledge of HTML and CSS to create a responsive layout, style elements, and present financial information effectively.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Balance Sheet project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to view the balance sheet web page.
3. Customize and modify the HTML and CSS files according to your preferences and requirements.
4. Test the responsiveness of the page across different devices and screen sizes to ensure it adapts smoothly.

## Project Structure

The project directory is structured as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure and content of the balance sheet web page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that provides styles and layout for the HTML elements.

Feel free to explore and modify the project files to meet your specific needs and enhance the design and functionality of the balance sheet web page.
