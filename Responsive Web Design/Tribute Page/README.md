# Tribute Page

Welcome to my Tribute Page project! This project is part of the Responsive Web Design curriculum offered by freeCodeCamp. It focuses on creating a responsive web page that pays tribute to a person or topic of your choice.

## Project Overview

The Tribute Page project aims to demonstrate my skills in building a responsive web page that honors and showcases a person or topic. By completing this project, I will have the opportunity to apply my knowledge of HTML and CSS to create an engaging tribute page that highlights the achievements and significance of the chosen subject.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Tribute Page project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to view the tribute page.
3. Customize and modify the HTML and CSS files according to your preferences and requirements.
4. Replace the placeholder content with the information, images, and media related to the person or topic you are paying tribute to.
5. Enhance the design and layout of the page by incorporating responsive techniques and visual elements that enhance the overall user experience.

## Project Structure

The project directory is structured as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure and content of the tribute page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that provides styles and layout for the HTML elements.

Feel free to explore and modify the project files to suit your specific needs and enhance the design and functionality of the tribute page.
