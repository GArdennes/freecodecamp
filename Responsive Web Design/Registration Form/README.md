# Registration Form

Welcome to my Registration Form project! This project is part of the Responsive Web Design curriculum offered by freeCodeCamp. It focuses on creating a responsive web page that allows users to register by filling out a form.

## Project Overview

The Registration Form project aims to demonstrate my skills in building a responsive web page with a user-friendly registration form. By completing this project, I will have the opportunity to apply my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and form validation to create a seamless user registration experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Registration Form project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to view the registration form.
3. Customize and modify the HTML and CSS files according to your preferences and requirements.
4. Enhance the form with appropriate input fields, labels, and validation to capture user information accurately.
5. Test the responsiveness and functionality of the page to ensure that the form works as expected on different devices and screen sizes.

## Project Structure

The project directory is structured as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure and content of the registration form page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that provides styles and layout for the HTML elements.

Feel free to explore and modify the project files to suit your specific needs and enhance the design and functionality of the registration form page.
