# Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my Personal Portfolio project! This project is part of the Responsive Web Design curriculum offered by freeCodeCamp. It focuses on creating a responsive web page that showcases my personal portfolio, including my skills, projects, and contact information.

## Project Overview

The Personal Portfolio project aims to demonstrate my skills as a web developer and showcase my work to potential clients or employers. By completing this project, I will have the opportunity to apply my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and responsive design to create a visually appealing and professional portfolio website.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Personal Portfolio project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to view the portfolio web page.
3. Customize and modify the HTML and CSS files according to your preferences and requirements.
4. Update the portfolio sections, add your projects, skills, and contact information to personalize the website.
5. Test the responsiveness of the page across different devices and screen sizes to ensure it adapts seamlessly.

## Project Structure

The project directory is structured as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure and content of the portfolio web page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that provides styles and layout for the HTML elements.

Feel free to explore and modify the project files to suit your specific needs and enhance the design and functionality of the portfolio website.
